# Mini-HPC-and-Hybrid-HPC-Big-Data-Clusters
This project implemented a hybrid computing system combining MPI-based HPC and Dockerized Spark clusters to analyze gene and protein expression data for disease classification. It demonstrates how distributed machine learning workflows can efficiently process bioinformatics datasets across virtualized environments.
